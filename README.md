# Redux-Store

## Description

This is my attempt at the redux store. Once the app is fully functioning the user will be able to signup or login, shop and purchase products from the store.

This was a bit of a challenge for me. I know the original README said there wouldn't be sweeping changes of code, but the things I noticed were very minimal. The biggest thing I did was rename my connection link in the connection.js file, adding comments to the reducers file and playing around with some hooks. Testing it out I'm able to signup and login, but despite seeding in every place possible I don't see any products popping up. It was a bit of an unusual assignment for me. I did get it to deploy on Heroku, which is a perk because I've had issues with Heroku through nearly the entire class.
